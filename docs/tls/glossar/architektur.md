There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.

- Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
- Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
- Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.
