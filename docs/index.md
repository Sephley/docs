This is where I will be documenting various modules related to school (for now).

## Markdown Syntax
for the sake of having some form of a guide.

### Italic
*Use the stars, my friend*

You can also change the strenth of the text, by adding more underscores
### Bold
**Use two stars, my friend**

You can also change the strenth of the text, by adding more stars

### Code
```
Here's a beautiful code block
```
### Blockquotes
> crocodile for the win

You can even add multiple paragraphs:
> wow
>
> how very interesting

Not only that, but you can also nest them:
> WOW
>
>> SO DAMN INTERESTING

It's even possible to add some other elements, like bullet points.
