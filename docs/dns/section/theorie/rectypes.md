### Record-Typen
|**Record**   |**Description**   |
|---|---|
|A   |Address record. A Records map server IP addresses to domain names. For example, 72.21.206.6 to amazon.com.     |
|AAAA   |Gleich wie A, aber mit IPv6.   |
|CNAME   |Canonical Name record. A CNAME record establishes one domain as an alias to another (thereby routing all traffic addressed to the alias to the target; the canonical address).     |
|Alias   |Like a CNAME record, Alias records can be used to map one address to another. But Aliases can coexist with other records using the same name.     |
|MX   |Mail Exchange Record. These records will redirect a domain’s email to the servers hosting the domain’s user accounts. Mail exchange records are used for determining the priority of email servers for a domain.   |
